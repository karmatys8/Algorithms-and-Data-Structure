# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description

The most interesting codes from Algorithms and Data Structures lessons at AGH IT 2nd semester.<br>
All of them are written by me, however some of them are inspired by others ideas/algorithms.
Some of them include descriptions of algorithms but if so they are in Polish. Hopefully someone can benefit from them.<br>
Tasks descriptions were added later and hence may be incomplete/incorrect.

## Study timeline

1. Sorts
2. Graphs
